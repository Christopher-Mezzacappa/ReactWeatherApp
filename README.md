# ReactWeatherApp
The goal I had in mind for this project was to use it so that I can get feel for the React JS library, aswell as the integration of APIs in my code. 

This is a weather app that is coded in React Js which implements a weather API that fetches real time data and displays it in a clean and appealing
for the user. It also includes Dynamic backgrounds which change based on the type of weather the current city you are looking at has.
